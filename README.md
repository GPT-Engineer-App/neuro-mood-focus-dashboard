# neuro-mood-focus-dashboard

A dashboard app for a Neurosity EEG device.
It should have:
- a card for the user's current classified mood and focus
- a card comparing the user's current state to their usual state at the current hour (more/less tired/focused/stressed?)
- a card for the raw EEG data (multiple timeseries, one per channel)
- a card with a call to action for "shifting into focus"
- a card with a call to action for "start meditation"

Make the design friendly, modern, and minimalistic. Emphasising Apple-esque design vibes combined with neurotech ideals.
